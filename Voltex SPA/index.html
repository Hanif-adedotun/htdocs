         What ERA are we in? That question rings a bell?
An ERA is a span of time defined for the purposes of chronology or historiography, as in the regal eras in the history of a given monarchy, a calendar era used for a given calendar, or the geological eras defined for the history of Earth. (Thanks to google.com)
What are you cooking up, that's going to be GENERATIONAL?
In fact, the more the GENERATION, the more the PROBLEM.
Our ERA, our Time, Our Generation has lots of PROBLEMS that needs solving.
Get Up and write your name of the sand of your ERA.
RATION
A fixed amount of a commodity officially allowed to each person during a time of shortage, as in wartime.
My People, we all inherit some GENERIC makeups that's intentional instil in us by GOD almighty to solve our era’s PROBLEM by applying the appropriate RATION.
It's very important we key in to this simple message because ASIANS Problem are not quite Peculiar to AFRICANS, Likewise EUROPEANS aren't quite peculiar to that of AMERICANS.
What do we NIGERIANS specialise in?
The question now is what do we AFRICANS specialise in?
Do you not wish to make a shift in the NIGERIAN paradigm of being a CONSUMING NATION?
Some days ago, someone was dissing Dangote.
Asking if it was his passion that gave him all is wealth.
Without his Passion to make Africa a Producer of Sugar, Salt, Cement and Co.
We might be an absolute consumer of everything.
Passion is Key, to provide people with what they need.
Dissolve your IDEAS and Make Africa Great.
